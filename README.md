What is SAMBA?
 Samba is an open-source software suite that provides file and print services to clients using the SMB (Server Message Block) and CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocols. These protocols are primarily used by Windows systems, but Samba allows Linux and Unix systems to seamlessly interact with Windows machines for file sharing and network communication.
 Key Features of Samba

    File and Printer Sharing:
        Enables Linux servers to share files and printers with Windows clients and other systems using SMB/CIFS.
    Cross-Platform Compatibility:
        Allows Linux and Windows machines to work together in mixed-network environments.
    Domain Controller:
        Can act as an Active Directory domain controller to manage authentication and authorization in a Windows domain.
    Authentication and Access Control:
        Integrates with Windows authentication systems, including Active Directory, NTLM, and Kerberos.
    Versatile Configurations:
        Supports flexible configurations for different access control levels, including public shares and user-restricted shares.
